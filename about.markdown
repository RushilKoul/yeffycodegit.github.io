## About me

Hey, im **Yeff**, a guy very interested in programming, computers, and anything software. I decided to make a blog website because...I have no clue why actually, I just wanted to write blogs on programming, share what im learning/working on and maybe help some people get started programming! If you want, you can you check out my [github](https://github.com/YeffyCodeGit) to check out some of my projects im working on, or just laugh at my horrible code, whichever sounds better to you.

## Things im interested in
Im mostly interested in anything programming based, but currently, im really into low level stuff. I love building massive systems, like game engines from scratch, and im actually working on my own engine called [Orbital](https://github.com/YeffyCodeGit/Orbital). However, Orbital has taken a back seat for now, as i've become a bit obbsessed with compilers, and am working on my own, which you can find [here](https://github.com/Unammed-Language-Project/Unammed-Language).



## Contact
If you want to contact me (i have no clue why you would, but just in case y'know), my discord account is Yeff#5084.
