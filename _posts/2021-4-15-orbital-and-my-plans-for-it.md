## What is Orbital?
Orbital is a 2D game engine im working on, written in the Java programming language. I mean for it to be a simple game engine/framework for game developers to be able to make small game prototypes quickly, but also make bigger games, while still keeping the codebase nice and simple. 

## Why Java?
This is a question im assuming a few people will ask. Why use Java, and not a lang like C/C++, which is much faster and much more commonly used for something like game engine dev? Well, firstly, I like Java. I learnt Java not too long back, but im a huge fan of Java's syntax and just like using it in general, unlike something like C++, which I *know*, and I used to enjoy it, but now I dont (preferences huh). Secondly, I tried C/C++ already. The first iteration of Orbital was written in C++ and DirectX, but I soon stopped on that because 1. DirectX is pain 2. Im bad at C++. Java was my first choice because 1. A friend of mine, Lucas Z (check out his github [here](https://github.com/lucasstarsz) btw) is making a Java game engine called [FastJ](https://github.com/lucasstarsz/FastJ) as well, and he inspired me quite a bit. In fact, the current version of Orbital even uses the same graphics api (Java2D) as FastJ! 2. Java is still quite a popular language for game development. 

## Goals? 
Well, my goals for projects are usually way too big for my skill level, so I had to do some consideration about my goals for Orbital. At first, back when I was writing Orbital in C++, I meant for the engine to be a powerful, industry-standard 3D and 2D engine, like Unity and Unreal. But I soon realized that something like that is waaaay to out of scope for me. So, I went for something smaller and simpler. I want Orbital to be a 2D engine which is simple to use. My main focus at this point is on simplicity. People should be able to just fire up a new project, type like 4 or 5 lines of code and get a basic window fired up. Simplicty is the **key** part of Orbital.


## Conclusion
I think thats all I have to say about Orbital for now. Any updates on Orbital will probably be found here in a new blog post. I hope you enjoyed reading this blog, have a good day! :D
